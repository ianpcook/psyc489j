Goals
-----

When leaving this course, you should be able to:

* reason about and discuss statistical models
* build and interpret linear models in R
* use Bayesian statistics to incorporate prior information and improve model accuracy
* construct sophisticated graphics to aid in the communication of statistical analysis

Description
-----

This course is designed to teach statistics from a model-building perspective.
We will discuss the linear model, extending it from t-tests to multiple discrete, continuous predictors and multilevel structures.
We will also cover the basics of the [CRAN R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) programming languages in order to build and test these models.
Using these programs and the concepts involved in linear modeling, we will advance to simulation methods and visual display of quantitative information.

Grades
-----

In-class assignments (50%)  
Take-home exam (50%)  

Every day in class we will have a short assignment on any material we have covered up to that point.
A take-home exam will be assigned before January $12^{th}$ and due on or before January $23^{rd}$. We will also do a substantial amount of ungraded work in-class.
I will happily review this work upon request, though it will not count for any grade.
No curve will be applied before the end of the course, so be conscious of the fact that your performance relative to the class average is the best indicator of your eventual grade.

Standard course policies & grade appeals
-----

You can find most of the standard UMD course policies [here]( http://ter.ps/psycsyllabi). 
Further guidelines regarding grading and final grade appeals be be found [here](ter.ps/gradeappeal).
Please be aware of these policies.

Per department policy, only final grades can be appealed above the class level.
Should you wish to have a grade on a particular assignment reconsidered, please submit a written statement of no more than 100 words detailing the request for re-grading the assignment.
For each written request, I will find a qualified colleague to re-grade the assignment.

Data substitution
-----

You are likely in this class because you intend to analyze data in the future.
For some people, that data analysis has already begun.
If you have data with similar structure to any of the example data we are using, feel free to substitute your own.
My only caveat is that I will need a copy of any data used in a graded assignment so that I can give proper feedback.
If you are not sure whether your data are appropriate, it never hurts to ask.
