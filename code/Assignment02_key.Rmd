Create a scatterplot relating age and igf-1. Would you draw any conclusions about the relationship between age and igf-1 based on this graph? Explain your answer.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ISwR)
data(juul)
qplot(age, igf1, data = juul)

# or ggplot(juul, aes(age, igf1)) + geom_point()
```

#### IGF-1 seems to have a strong increase during adolesence, then drop off immediately and decrease slowly over the lifespan.

Recode sex as a factor. Create boxplots relating IGF-1 to sex.

```{r}
juul$sex2 <- factor(juul$sex)
qplot(sex2, igf1, data = juul, geom = "boxplot")

# or qplot(factor(sex), igf1, data = juul)
```
