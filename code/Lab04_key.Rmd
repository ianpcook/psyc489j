Lab 4
=====

1. Load the sleep dataset
2. Model extra as a function of group.
3. Interpret the model. Make specific reference to the meaning of the parameters and how they relate to differences between the groups.
4. Plot this model in at least two ways.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
invisible(lapply(c("arm", "ISwR", "ggplot2"), require, character.only = TRUE))
data(sleep)
fit1 <- lm(extra ~ group, data = sleep)
display(fit1)
qplot(group, extra, data = sleep, geom = "boxplot")
qplot(group, extra, data = sleep, geom = "jitter", position = position_jitter(.25))
```
