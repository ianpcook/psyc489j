1. Load the data in exPermData.mat from last Friday.
2. Reformat the data and run a t test on it using the t.test function.
3. At this point either:
  * Fit a BESTmcmc model to the exPerm data; or,
  * Load the BESTmcmc model form the ex_perm.RData file.
4. Interpret the coefficients. Do these groups differ on any parameter?
5. Get the 50% CI for both mu1 and mu2 by accessing the BESTmcmc object without using summary.

```{r}
library(R.matlab)
library(reshape2)
library(BEST)
dat <- readMat("~/Dropbox/statistics/students/labs/permExData.mat")
df <- melt(dat)
df$L1 <- factor(df$L1)
with(df, t.test(value[unclass(L1) == 1], value[unclass(L1) == 2]))
#with(df, BESTmcmc(value[unclass(L1) == 1], value[unclass(L1) == 2]))
load("students/models/ex_perm.RData")
summary(ex.perm.model)
quantile(ex.perm.model$mu1, probs = c(.25, .75))
quantile(ex.perm.model$mu2, probs = c(.25, .75))
```

```
These groups differ on both mean and variability.
Our expected difference is nearly 2 standard deviations according to the effSz parameter, which is a large magnitude difference.
