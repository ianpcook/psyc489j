You are supervising a group of 4 people.
You know that you will see their IQ scores in their employee file and decide that you could have a stupid group, a moderate group, or a smart group. We assume that the variance, $\sigma^2$, will be 100.
These are represented by three different hypotheses:

* $\mu$ = 90 (stupid)
* $\mu$ = 100 (moderate)
* $\mu$ = 110 (smart)

1. Assign prior probabilities to each of these hypotheses/parameter values.
2. You then see the scores: 75, 112, 100, 99. Calculate a likelihood for each hypothesis.
3. Use Bayes' rule to determine the posterior probability of each hypothesis.

```{r}
priors <- c(.5, .25, .25)
means <- c(90, 100, 110)
obs <- c(75, 112, 100, 99)
gsd <- 10
lik <- sapply(means, function(x) exp(sum(log(dnorm(obs, mean = x, sd = gsd)))))
posts <- lik * priors/sum(lik)
lik
posts
```
